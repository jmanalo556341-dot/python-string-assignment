This is a simple Python-based console program that performs various operations on a user-provided sentence. The program allows you to interactively manipulate and analyze text through a menu-driven interface.

## Features

Once a sentence is entered, the following operations are available:

1. **Reverse the sentence**  
   Reverses the entire sentence character by character.

2. **Count vowels**  
   Counts and displays the number of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) in the sentence (case-insensitive).

3. **Check palindrome**  
   Checks whether the sentence is a palindrome (ignores spaces and case).

4. **Find and replace a word**  
   Allows the user to find a word in the sentence and replace it with another.

5. **Format (Title Case)**  
   Converts the sentence to title case (first letter of each word capitalized).

6. **Split into words**  
   Splits the sentence into a list of words based on spaces.

7. **Word frequency counter**  
   Displays the frequency of each word in the sentence.

8. **Swap Case**  
   Swaps the case of each character (uppercase becomes lowercase and vice versa).

9. **Exit**  
   Terminates the program.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python program.
2. Enter a sentence when prompted.
3. Choose an operation from the menu by typing a number (1â€“9).
4. The result will be displayed immediately.
5. You can continue selecting different operations until you choose to exit.

Enter sentence:  Hello World

1: Reverse the sentence
2: Count vowels
3: Check palindrome
4: Find and replace a word
5: Format (Title Case)
6: Split into words
7: Word frequency counter
8: Swap Case
9: Exit
